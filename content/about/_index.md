Welcome to my blog!

My name is Thieu Nguyen, I'm living in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. My hometown is Phu Yen, a province of South Central Coast Region.

I'm currently working for a Finland company as a full-time Ruby on Rails engineer.

I am very interested in programming and technology. When I have free time, I often find some cool stuffs on internet to optimize my workflow.

Currently, I'm also learning another powerful languages:
